# fibonasty

Program shows two different implementations of the fibonacci sequence in two separate functions. 

function 1 - top-down 
calculates the Fibonacci value by calling itself twice with values n-1 and n-2 then adding the results together.

function 2 - bottom-up 
The second function will mimic a loop in function form. Starts from the first Fibonacci value and continues to calculate each next value until the desired one is reached.
